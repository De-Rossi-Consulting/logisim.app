[Logisim.app](https://logisim.app) is a fully featured browser-based port of classic [Logisim](https://www.cburch.com/logisim/): a widely used educational tool for designing  and simulating digital logic circuits.

This project is a complete 1:1 port of the original Java application (based on version 2.7.2) running in the browser powered by [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). It uses [CheerpJ](https://cheerpj.com/) (a complete browser runtime for Java apps) to execute the compiled JAR file directly in the browser. It also includes a lightweight JavaScript layer to provide browser-compatible file operations.

This allows Logisim.app to be used in any modern browsers and devices (including mobile!) without the need for installation or a Java runtime environment.

## Documentation

Since this project doesn't change any of Logisim's core features, you can refer the documentation built into the application and the [original logisim documentation](https://www.cburch.com/logisim/docs.html) for usage details.

### Working with Files
Logisim.app allows you to work with files from your local computer, or from a virtual filesystem in the browser (implemented on top of IndexedDB).

Whenever you try to open or save a file, you will see the following prompt:

![File open dialog](./.github/open-file.png)

- **Local desktop** refers to your computer's file system.
- **Browser memory** refers to the virtual file system in the browser.

Once a file has been opened, the application functions equivalently in both cases.

[!NOTE]: All files stored in the virtual filesystem in the browser are cleared if you delete site data for logisim.app.

## Building and Running Logisim.app

This project contains:
- A copy of the original [Logisim source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/), minimally modified to sypport file handling in the browser.
- A lightweight HTML/CSS/JS frontend.

### Dependencies

To build and run it, you'll need:

- [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Java 8+ (Any recent version of [OpenJDK ](https://openjdk.org/install/) should work)
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


### Running the application locally
To run the repo locally, clone this repository and use npm to run a local dev server:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/De-Rossi-Consulting/logisim-legacy-wasm.git
cd logisim-legacy-wasm
npm install
npm run dev
```

If everything is working, you should see something like the following:

```
> logisim-legacy-wasm@0.0.0 dev
> vite


  VITE v6.2.5  ready in 671 ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  âžœ  Network: use --host to expose
  âžœ  press h + enter to show help
```

If you want to modify the java files, you will need to **build the `.jar` file**.

### Building the `.jar` file

To build the `.jar` file, run the `create-jar.py` script included in the original source code:

```sh
python3 /PATH_TO_REPO/logisim-legacy-wasm/logisim/scripts/create-jar.py -d /PATH_TO_REPO/logisim-legacy-wasm/public
```

[!NOTE]: Make sure to replace `PATH_TO_REPO` with the absolute path to the repositry directory

This will build the `.jar` file and place it in `/public`, and you can reload the application to see your changes.
